#### 2. Atlas Meta Pattern Insights

**Migration/Bonding Curve Progress**
- First major pump occurs within 0–30 min after migration (>90% bonding curve).
- Migration is the prime entry signal for early pumps.

**Fresh Wallet %**
- Sustainable/multiphase pumps: Fresh hold % >5–8% and rising at migration.
- Sub-5% fresh wallets: Pump is short-lived, fades quickly.
- Rising fresh wallet % during pump = better chance for trailing base.

**Bot Holders**
- >30% bots: High volatility, orchestrated pumps/dumps, scalp only.
- <30% bots: More stable, better for holding if other signals align.

**Top 10 Holder %**
- <25% is healthy, but only predictive for sustainability when paired with fresh wallet growth.

**Insider Hold %**
- >5% insiders: Higher risk of coordinated dump immediately post-pump.
- Pair with other metrics for risk management.

**Liquidity & Order Book Depth**
- $25K–$50K liquidity: Sweet spot for big moves without excessive whale dominance.
- Deep order book (20+ makers): Enables safe entries/exits, but only predictive with fresh wallet growth.

**Volume & Wallet Churn**
- Volume and wallet churn spike at migration: Best early detection for organic demand and initial pump.

#### 3. Updated Meta Filter & Playbook

| Filter                | Rule/Threshold                         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Migration Status      | Dex paid, migrated, >90% progress      |
| Fresh Hold %          | >5–8% for entry, >10% ideal            |
| Top 10 Hold %         | <25%                                   |
| Bot Holder %          | <30% preferred (higher = scalp only)   |
| Insider Hold %        | <5%                                    |
| Liquidity             | $25K–$50K                              |
| Order Book Makers     | >20 for safe entry/exit                |
| Volume/Wallet Churn   | Entry on volume + wallet spike         |
| Exit Timing           | Exit at first volume/fresh % fade      |
| Re-entry              | Only on new base + fresh wallet growth |

#### 4. On-Chain & Off-Chain Research Integration

- **On-chain checks:** Use Solscan, Photon, Birdeye to track migration events, wallet churn, holder distribution, bot/insider % in real time.
- **Historical pattern:** All coins with early pumps after migration show a spike in both wallet churn and fresh wallet %.
- **Off-chain hype:** Social sentiment can catalyze wallet churn; combine alerts for maximum edge.

---

#### 5. New Additions/Refinements

- **Insider Hold %** now tracked and filtered (<5% preferred).
- **Live monitoring** of wallet churn, migration progress, and real-time alerts for coins hitting thresholds.
- **Automated filter suggestion:** Combine migration, fresh wallet %, bot % and insider %, liquidity, and order book depth for actionable entries.

---

#### 6. Persistent Knowledge Update

- **Most reliable forward indicator:** Fresh wallet % rising at migration.
- **Best entry:** 0–30 min post-migration, with wallet churn and volume spike.
- **Best exit:** First sign of volume/fresh wallet fade, especially if high bots/insiders detected.
- **Never hold through secondary pumps unless fresh wallets surge again.**
- **Insider hold above 5% = high risk for orchestrated dump.**
- **Deep order book and healthy liquidity only matter if paired with retail wallet growth.**

## Restoration Instructions

1. Decode this file from Base64 to plaintext if encoded.
2. Review the full session timeline and context snapshot.
3. Restore all code, logic, reasoning, persona, and checklists from the decoded file.
4. Use as the "brain" for new Copilot instance—continue work with no knowledge loss.
5. Retain persona ("Atlas") and all session details.
