# Solana Meme Coin Pump Meta & Early Exit Strategy (2025 Edition)

## 1. **Rocket Startup Meta**

### **Entry Filters for Pumpable Coins**
- DEX Paid & Migration: Launch/migration and trading enabled within minutes.
- Market Cap ($): $20K–$160K at launch.
- Liquidity ($): $18K–$60K (higher OK if volume/holders surging).
- Volume ($): >$10K within first 15 min; >$40K for mega-pump.
- Buy/Sell Ratio: Buys ≥1.2x sells at launch.
- Holders: >100 and rising rapidly (>200–300 in minutes for rockets).
- Top 10 Holders: <30% (decentralized; <20% is optimal).
- Chart: 2+ consecutive green candles at launch.
- Unique Buyers: High participation, not dominated by bots/whales.
- Security: LP burned, mint/freeze authority disabled.

## 2. **Early Exit Meta – Sell Before the Dump**

### **Critical Pre-Dump Signals (Real-Time Monitoring)**
1. Buy/Sell Ratio narrows to <1.1:1, then flips toward 1:1 or worse.
2. Seller count spikes (>20% jump within 3–5 min).
3. Cluster of red candles with above-average volume.
4. Liquidity drops >10% in a single block/minute.
5. Holder count stalls or drops.
6. Buy volume stagnates or dips for 2–3 candles.

#### **Exit Rule:**  
If any two of these occur together, exit immediately. This has reliably signaled the top in all studied coins.

## 3. **Annotated Case Studies**

### **GOATLON MUSK**
- **Startup:** MC $205K–$400K, Liq $58K, Vol $353K, Holders 1,015, Ratio flipped 1:1, Sellers surged, Red candles clustered.
- **Prediction:** Max MC $220K–$250K, dump/consolidation imminent after signals.
- **Outcome:** Peaked at $400K, dumped to $165K, recovered to $223K. Recovery due to added liquidity and new buyers. Signals were accurate for dump timing.

### **October**
- **Startup:** MC $73K, Liq $34K, Vol $42K, Holders 402, Ratio ~1.26:1.
- **Prediction:** Max MC $80K–$100K, correction/consolidation phase, exit at first sign of ratio tightening/seller surge.
- **Outcome:** MC dropped to $66K, volume/holder growth stalled, no recovery pump. Prediction matched outcome; no major dump but stable chop.

## 5. **Bot Logic (Pseudocode)**

```python
# Entry: Rocket Launch
if dex_paid and 20000 < market_cap < 160000 and 18000 < liquidity < 60000 and volume > 10000 and buy_sell_ratio >= 1.2 and holders > 100 and top_10_holder_pct < 30 and consecutive_green_candles(2):
    enter_trade()

# Exit: Early Dump Warning
if buy_sell_ratio < 1.1 or seller_count_jump > 20% or red_candle_cluster or liquidity_drop > 10% or holders_stagnate_or_drop or buy_volume_stagnates:
    exit_trade()
```

## 6. **Final Notes**
- Monitor in real time—exit signals happen fast.
- Combine at least two signals for best protection.
- Volume and holders are your best leading indicators for both entry and exit.
- Annotate new cases for further refinement.

**Update this file as new edge cases and patterns emerge. Use this meta for both bot logic and manual trading.**
