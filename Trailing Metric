## Case Study: Trailing/Dead Coin Phase

### October
- **Pump to MC $66K, then sharp correction to $30K, volume nearly dead ($3K), holders down to 340.**
- **No new FOMO, liquidity thin, buy/sell volume flat.**
- **Conclusion:** Entered dead phase, unlikely to recover without major outside hype.

### GOATLON MUSK
- **Pump to $400K MC, trailing now at $184K, liquidity $56K, volume down to $19K, holders stable at 1113.**
- **Still decentralized, but volume/liquidity trending down, buy/sell balance flat.**
- **Conclusion:** Trailing phase, slightly healthier than October, but same dead/chop risk unless hype returns.

### Meta Signals for Trailing/Dead Phase
- Volume drops >80% from peak
- Holder count stalls/drops
- Liquidity thins
- Buy/sell balance flat, low activity
- Red candle clusters
- Social sentiment collapse

**If 3+ present, coin is likely dead/trailing. Exit or avoid as revival probability is very low.**
