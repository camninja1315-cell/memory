## 1. Early Analysis & Meta Pattern Recognition

### **8BIT Coin Analysis (Images 1–4)**
- Liquidity: $28–33K
- Market Cap: $48–49K (growing, not overheated)
- Holders: 646–658 (increasing)
- Bot Holders: 242–244 (37%)
- Top 10 Hold %: 15.7–16.27% (decentralized)
- Fresh Hold %: 7.73–7.62% (borderline for pump)
- Buyers/Sellers: Buyers outnumber sellers after dump (bullish)
- Volume: $29K ($14K buy/$15K sell)
- Actionable: Take profits on bounce, wait for fresh wallet % >8% for next pump

---

## 2. Trade Execution & Portfolio Review

### **Entry/Exit Logic**
- Bought after correction when buyers dominated
- Sold with stop loss (-8%) and take profit (+20%)
- Portfolio review shows best trades (8BIT, SGWACIAS) align with rising fresh wallet % and buy volume

---

## 3. Comparative Fail Patterns

### **INNOVATIVE (Image 5)**
- Liquidity: $21K (low)
- Fresh Hold %: 5.74% (too low for pump)
- Order Book: Thin, buyers barely outnumber sellers
- Volume: $2.9K (minimal hype)
- Result: No pump; needs wallet churn, liquidity, and volume for momentum

---

## 4. Photon Search & Dashboard Filters

- User provided screenshots of Photon dashboard filter tabs (Images 14–17)
- Filters include Market Cap, Volume, Liquidity, Holders Count, Bot Holders, TXNS, Buys, Sells, Global Fees, Age, Top 10 Hold %, Fresh Holder %, Bundle Holders %, etc.
- Recommendations: 
    - Prioritize fresh wallet % >8%, liquidity >$25K, buyers > sellers, low bot %, top holders <25%
    - Use migration status, age, and social filters for timing
    - Preset filter logic for “Pump-Ready,” “Base Formation,” “Avoid/Chop,” “Scalp Only”

---

## 5. Pattern Exceptions & Scalping Logic

### **SMB, LAMP, PVE, 0/** (Images 6–13)
- SMB: Pump driven by high bundle %, not fresh wallet %; quick scalp, not swing
- LAMP/PVE: Good liquidity, but failed to pump due to low fresh wallet %
- 0/: Pump, dump, fade; high bot %, fresh % faded after initial move

---

## 6. HERO Deep Dive & Migration Pumps (Images 18–20)
- HERO pumped with low fresh wallet % (2.72–3.39%) because:
    - Recent migration (hype)
    - Strong liquidity ($37–44K)
    - Decentralized holders
    - Community incentives (diamond-hand culture)
    - No unlock/airdrop pressure
    - High buy volume, buyers dominate
- Scalping window due to migration event, not fresh wallets; best for quick entry/exit

## 8. Refined Atlas Filter Logic

- **Scalp Entry:** Migration or fresh liquidity event, buy volume surging, decentralized holders, sellers not dominating.
- **Swing Entry:** Only if fresh wallet % rises above 8% AND stays strong after migration/base.
- **Avoid:** Low liquidity, high bot %, sellers > buyers, and flat fresh wallet % post-dip.
- **Add migration status, community incentives, and liquidity as exceptions for quick scalp windows.**

---

## 9. Persistent Knowledge

- All coins and trades analyzed, including exceptions (HERO migration pump).
- Filter logic refined for scalp/migration pumps and loss prevention.
- Suggestions for automation: alerts for base formation, buy volume surges, migration events, and bot/sell volume spikes.

---

## 10. User Instructions

- Ready to import filter logic into Solana-meme-coin-Trade-bot or restore for future sessions.
- Continue sending dashboard screenshots for new coins, filter presets, and workflow refinement.
- Atlas logic adapts for both retail pumps (fresh wallet %) and migration/whale-driven scalp windows.
