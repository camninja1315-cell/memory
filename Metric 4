## Latest Meta Analysis & Trading Insights (Session Continuation)

### Recent Coins Reviewed
- **GWACIAS:** Strong pump post-migration, fresh wallet % above threshold, high bot activity, optimal liquidity. Price kept running after initial exit—key lesson: hold longer if fresh wallet % keeps rising and volume/buyers stay strong.
- **RANDY:** Classic meta-pattern. Initial pump, sharp dump, very high fresh wallet % (20%+), decentralized top holders, moderate bot concentration. Watch for secondary pump if fresh wallets and buyers surge post-dump.

---

### Trading Performance Review
- Multiple trades on GWACIAS, SMei, SmcRib, STrum, Sowl. Good winrate, but most profits are small, leaving larger moves on the table. Losses occur after entering dips or selling too early before biggest pump.
- **Main loss driver:** Exiting on volatility or small gains, not trusting meta signals (fresh wallet %, volume, migration status).
- **Key mindset fix:** Hold longer with trailing stops, scale out instead of full exit, only sell when meta signals fade (fresh wallet %, buyers, volume drop).
