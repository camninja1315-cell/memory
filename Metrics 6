## Patterns & Exceptions

### Patterns for Scalpable Migration/Dump Pumps
- **Migration event with hype** triggers a pump even if fresh wallet % is low, IF liquidity is strong and top holders are decentralized.
- **Scalping window** opens right after migration or first dip, as buyers rush in and volume spikes.
- **Exit quickly** if fresh wallet % does not rise, or if bot % climbs and sell volume surges.

### Patterns for Failed/Chop Moves
- **Low fresh wallet % (<8%)** with no migration or hype = no pump, chop or fade.
- **High bot % (>50%)** = pump/dump, scalp only.
- **High bundle %** works for quick pumps, but not for multi-phase moves unless paired with fresh wallets.
- **Low liquidity (<$25K)** = fade risk.

### Exceptions to Fresh Wallet Rule
- **Migration pumps (HERO):** Can run with low fresh wallet % if liquidity, decentralization, and community incentives are strong.
- **Whale/repeat buyer moves:** Sometimes repeat buyers and whales drive pumps without new wallets; these are scalp-only opportunities.

## Refined Entry Filter

- **Scalp Entry:** Migration or fresh liquidity event, buy volume surging, decentralized holders, sellers not dominating.
- **Swing Entry:** Only if fresh wallet % rises above 8% AND stays strong after migration/base.
- **Avoid:** Low liquidity, high bot %, sellers > buyers, and flat fresh wallet % post-dip.

---

## Improvements

- Layer **migration event filter** on top of wallet churn/fresh % filter.
- Use **liquidity, buy volume, and top holder decentralization** to identify safe scalp windows.
- Always check for **community/staking/LP incentives** and social sentiment on migration coins.
- Set **exit alerts** for rising bot % or sell volumeâ€”and avoid holding through chop.
- Monitor **migration announcements and liquidity incentives** via social feeds and project Discord/Twitter.
- **Automate alerts** for base formation and buy volume surges post-migration.
- **Track repeat buyer/whale activity** in addition to fresh wallet churn.
