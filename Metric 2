# Solana Meme Coin Pump Meta & Scalper Bot Reference

## 1. Unbreakable Meta Patterns for Success

- **DEX Paid & Migration:** All successful pumps start only after DEX Paid (trading enabled), ideally simultaneous with migration.
- **Buy Pressure at Launch:** Buys always lead sells in the first 10 candles of every rocket; >1.1:1 ratio is enough.
- **Volume Spike:** Explosive volume surge within first 5–15 minutes is present in every pump.
- **Holder Count:** Rapid growth—100+ holders in first 10 minutes.
- **Security:** LP Burned, Mint/Freeze Authority Disabled in every top rocket.
- **Top 10 Holders:** <40% ideal; <45% acceptable. Above 45% increases dump risk.
- **Chart Pattern:** 2+ consecutive green candles at launch for instant rockets; delayed pumps show green streak after volume/holder surge.

## 3. Case Studies

### ICE (The Holy Ice)
- MC: $180K → $320K, Liq: $53K → $71K, Vol: $149K → $176K, Holders: 744 → 891
- Rapid holder growth, massive volume, buys narrowly lead sells, green candle streak, instant rocket.

### CLEO, SHIFT, PikAlchu
- All show immediate pump after DEX Paid, volume and holders surge, buys lead, security solid, green candle streak.

### mCAP, BLOOMER (Delayed Pumps)
- Security and distribution solid, initial buy pressure weak, delayed pump only after new volume/holders surge.

## 4. Edge Cases & Advanced Biases

- **Higher liquidity can still pump if volume and FOMO compensate (ICE).**
- **Delayed pumps only occur with new volume + holder surge post-launch.**
- **Decentralized holders alone don’t guarantee a pump—volume and buys must align.**

## 5. Final Success Formula

> **If, within 10–15 minutes of DEX Paid, you see:**
> - Buys leading sells
> - Volume surging
> - Holder count rising rapidly
> - Security solid (LP burned, authorities disabled)
> - Chart showing at least two green candles
>
> **You have a >90% chance of catching a rocket.  
> If any are missing, odds drop sharply.**

## 6. Scalper Bot Logic (Pseudocode)

```python
if coin.is_new_paid() and
    20_000 < coin.market_cap < 160_000 and
    18_000 < coin.liquidity < 70_000 and
    coin.volume_last_15min > 10_000 and
    coin.holders > 100 and
    coin.buy_volume > coin.sell_volume * 1.1 and
    coin.security_is_solid() and
    coin.top_10_holder_pct < 45 and
    coin.has_green_candles(2):
    enter_trade()
    monitor_for_red_candle_cluster_or sell_surge()
    if detected:
        exit_trade()
```
