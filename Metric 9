# Photon Trade Decider: Refined Adaptive Metrics & Scaling (Markup Notes)

## 1. **Core Metrics Used**

- **Current Price**: Scraped from Photon DOM.
- **Liquidity**: Key filter for healthy coins (>18K preferred).
- **Market Cap**: Provides context for scale of moves.
- **Fresh Hold %**: Recent wallet % (high is bullish).
- **Bundle Hold %**: Indicates top holder concentration.
- **Bot Holders %**: High % can indicate bot risk/chop.
- **Top 10 Hold %**: If >25%, avoid (whale risk).
- **Buyers/Sellers Count**: Momentum, exit signals.
- **Buy/Sell Ratio**: >1.08 bullish, <1 bearish, flat = trailing.
- **Volume**: Both overall and wick/candle volume for pump/dip detection.
- **Holders**: Stalling/dropping signals trailing/dead phase.

## 2. **Adaptive Metrics & Scaling Logic**

### **A. Wick/Candle Analysis**
- Scrape latest wick (O/H/L/C/Vol/Color) from TradingView legend DOM.
- **Pump signal**: 3+ green candles in lookback, with volume spike.
- **Dip signal**: 3+ red candles in lookback, with volume spike.
- **Sideways**: Price move <2.5% in lookback, low/moderate volume.
- **Decision Point**: Sideways but volume rising.

### **B. Trailing/Dead Phase Detection**
- Volume drops >80% from peak.
- Holder count stalls/drops.
- Liquidity thins (<15K).
- Buy/Sell balance flat, low activity.
- Red candle clusters.
- If 3+ present, coin is likely dead/trailing.

### **C. Trade Scaling Factor**
- Compute based on:
    - Price change magnitude (pump/dip).
    - Volume ratio (current/avg).
    - Fresh/bundle % pop/dip.
    - Buy/sell ratio pop/dip.
    - Volatility, ladder pattern detection.
- Higher scaling for:
    - Strong pump with healthy bundle/fresh/buyers.
    - Lower scaling for trailing or chop.

## 3. **Entry/Exit Adaptive Logic**

- **Entry (Buy):**
    - Liquidity >18K
    - Top 10 hold <25%
    - Not trailing phase
    - Pump signals (ladder, volume, buy/sell ratio, bundle/fresh %)
    - Buy only if bundle <=80, buy/sell ratio >1.08, buyers > sellers

- **Exit:**
    - Price change >=+22% or <=-8%
    - Buyers < sellers
    - Scaling factor drops >20%
    - Trailing phase detected

---

## 4. **Console Output Markup**

- Logs every tick:
    - Coin symbol, mint, type (ladder/dip/neutral), status (pumping, dumping, trailing, sideways, decision-point)
    - Latest wick: O/H/L/C/Vol/Color
    - Scaling factor, entry/exit triggers

---

## 5. **Best Practices for Scaling**

- Use **peakVolume** context when judging volume spikes/drops.
- Only increase trade size on confirmed pump ladder (not chop).
- Use adaptive weights for fresh/bundle/volatility in scaling computation.
- Avoid entries on trailing/chop signals.

## 6. **Example Status/Scaling Print**

```
SEEN COIN: Fartcoin, Mint: ..., Type: ladder, Status: pumping
LATEST WICK: O102K H104K L100K C103K Vol:8.2K Color:green
ScaleFactor: 1.32
BUY IN at $0.000105 [2025-10-06 18:00], Type: ladder, Status: pumping, WickColor: green, ScaleFactor: 1.32
```

## 7. **Extensible Metrics (for future adaptive upgrades)**

- Add on-chain sentiment if available.
- Track historical migration events for meme coins (bar index).
- Integrate EMA/Bollinger or other TA overlays for confirmation.
